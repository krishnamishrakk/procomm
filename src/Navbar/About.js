        Founded in 2022 by Akarsh Gupta, All In One store has come a long way from its beginnings in a 
        home office. When Akarsh gupta
        first started out, his/her passion for  helping other parents be more eco-friendly,
        providing the best equipment for his fellow musicians drove him to  do intense research,
        quit her day job, and gave him the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into to a booming online store. 
        We now serve customers all over the India, and are thrilled to be a part of the  quirky, eco-friendly, fair trade wing of the 
        fashion, baked goods, watches industry."
